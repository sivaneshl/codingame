# Goal
# Ghost Legs is a kind of lottery game common in Asia. It starts with a number of vertical lines. Between the lines
# there are random horizontal connectors binding all lines into a connected diagram, like the one below.
#
# A  B  C
# |  |  |
# |--|  |
# |  |--|
# |  |--|
# |  |  |
# 1  2  3
#
# To play the game, a player chooses a line in the top and follow it downwards. When a horizontal connector is
# encountered, he must follow the connector to turn to another vertical line and continue downwards. Repeat this until
# reaching the bottom of the diagram.
#
# In the example diagram, when you start from A, you will end up in 2. Starting from B will end up in 1. Starting from
# C will end up in 3. It is guaranteed that every top label will map to a unique bottom label.
#
# Given a Ghost Legs diagram, find out which top label is connected with which bottom label. List all connected pairs.
# Input
# Line 1: Integer W and H for width and height of the diagram below.
# Next H lines: Containing a Ghost Legs diagram as your input.
#
# The diagram itself is composed of characters: '|' and '-', (and space).
# The top line in the diagram has a number of labels T.
# The bottom line contains labels B.
#
# Each T and B is a single ascii character that can be of any random value.
# Do not assume they will always be ABC or 123.
#
# As a rule of the game, left and right horizontal connectors will never appear at the same point.
#
# All diagrams are having the same style as the test cases.
# Output
# List all connected pairs between top and bottom labels, TB, in the order of the top labels from Left to Right.
# Write each pair in a separate line.
# Constraints
# 3 < W, H â‰¤ 100
#
# Example
# Input
# 7 7
# A  B  C

# |--|  |

# 1  2  3
# Output
# A2
# B1
# C3
